Munches: Munches are social gatherings, which are generally held at restaurants. These are weeknight events which center around food, drink, and discussion with fellow kinksters. They offer a relaxed atmosphere and are an excellent way to meet people and begin to explore kink.
Pittsburgh Bridge Munch: Roland’s

7 p.m. on the first Tuesday of the month at Roland’s Seafood Grill in the Strip District.

Rolands Seafood Grill

Roland’s is one of our favorite venues. It offers a large, private area upstairs with a deck, pool tables, a huge bar, a lounge, and all the space we need to stretch out. Downstairs, where This Generation Pittsburgh is held, is a smaller, comfortable space with a cozy fireplace. Summer or winter, Roland’s is a fantastic place to enjoy an evening with friends.

 
Pittsburgh Bridge Munch: Sing-Sing

7 p.m. on the fourth Tuesday of the month at Sing-Sing at the waterfront.

The place is usually closed to the public on Tuesdays, so when they open it’s a private event just for Pittsburgh Bridge!  Sing-Sing features the same food and drink menu that you might know from the Rock Bottom restaurant and brewery, so there are plenty of great options!

 
Pittsburgh Bridge Bonus Munch

7 p.m. on the fifth Tuesday of the month at various locations throughout the city.
