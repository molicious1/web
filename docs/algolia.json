Our various events provide different social experiences and atmospheres. It is helpful to select the type of event that best suits your personality.\nDo you want a large group setting in which you can see a good range of members of the local scene?\nThe Roland’s Munch the first Tuesday of the month is where it’s at! This munch gathers 100+ local kinksters into all different kinds of play and from many different walks of life.\nJames St Pub also brings in between 60 to 80 folks each month in a more intimately sized venue.\nDo you want a smaller social setting in which you can get a feel for a few people at a time?\nOn the second Tuesday of the month we offer an event for the under 35 age group: TNG Pittsburgh (35 and under). This makes for more low key events, and can be ideal for those who feel more comfortable with their age peers.\nHappy Hours and Sloshes are smaller high energy events with a rowdier atmosphere.\nBonus munches on the fifth Tuesday of month at various locations draw about 40 to 60 attendees.\nDo you want to learn from more experienced players?\nBridge has three education based events: FUNdamentals, EDGEucation, and The TNG Meeting. Some of the other local groups like Threshold, Ropebite, Hitchin Bitches also have instructional events. Timing\nIf you can, think about arriving right at the posted start time. It will allow you to acclimate to the venue, and have more focused conversations with the host and others without the sense of having to compete with as many others for their attention. What to Wear\nYou don’t need to dress up, but pick something in which you feel you look good. People show up in work clothes, dresses, jeans and t shirts, Sunday best, and everything in between.\nYou should only wear fetish, bondage gear, or extremely revealing clothing to parties. And even then, cover up until …","date":1474502400,"description":"","lastmod":"2016-09-22T00:00:00Z","objectID":"cfaebac233976fe9d0be3accfafef988","permalink":"https://pghbridge.github.io/web/blog/advice/","publishdate":"2016-09-22T00:00:00Z","title":"Advice For Your First Event"},{"content":"One very common theme that I hear across many new attendees to our munches is an expression of anxiety or uncertainty about joining the community. I am commonly asked if it is appropriate for a new or curious person to just show up, or if it is acceptable to just walk up to others at the event and introduce yourself. The answer to both of those question is emphatically yes.\nOne of the primary purposes of our munches is to help others meet and connect with new friends. When you walk into Roland’s, James Street Pub, or any other of our events – remember that every person in that room has had to at some point or other come out to a community event for the first time. Nobody is going to demand your resume, qualifications, or references before they will to talk to you. We are all here to make friends, so as a new attendee keep in mind that the social interactions that you’re anxious about aren’t just acceptable, they’re literally the point.\nAnother common question that I hear is “What do people talk about? I’m brand new so I won’t really have anything to contribute to kink related discussions.” This, too, is perfectly okay! While it is quite normal for newer folks to simply ask questions and learn from others about their areas of interest, many other new attendees aren’t comfortable walking in the door and divulging their fantasies and desires to strangers. If that’s the case, please come anyway! Pittsburgh Bridge is a non-judgmental, open community for a diverse swath of alternative lifestyles – and if this sounds like an environment that is desirable to you, there’s no requirement to take the discussion about your own sexuality any further.\nIn fact, take a walk around our munches on a busy night and you will hear discussions about upcoming movies, television, theater, hair styles, the most desirable breed of dog, which local bar makes their drinks the strongest, iPhone vs. Android, upcoming concerts, The Pittsburgh Penguins, video games, and everything else under the …","date":1470268800,"description":"","lastmod":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","objectID":"bddad610eb94112ab812fd08432a8e2d","permalink":"https://pghbridge.github.io/web/blog/not-scary/","publishdate":"2016-08-04T00:00:00Z","title":"The BDSM Community - It's Not That Scary After All"},{"content":"","date":1597276800,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","objectID":"a631103cf606bbead447236a29c6889e","permalink":"https://pghbridge.github.io/web/calendar/","publishdate":"2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","title":"Community Calendar"},{"content":"An overview:\nMunches\nMunches are social gatherings, which are generally held at restaurants.

It offers a large, private area upstairs with a deck, pool tables, a huge bar, a lounge, and all the space we need to stretch out.

Anyone engaging in rude or disruptive behavior will be warned. If the behavior continues, the person may be asked to leave and not attend further Pittsburgh Bridge events.\nMost Bridge events are held in public restaurants. These venues welcome the kink community, but there are acceptable levels of dress and behavior that we must maintain. Fetish and sexy clothing is welcome and encouraged, but because these are public venues, it is not acceptable to expose more than would be allowed in any other public place.\nAlthough many of our events take place at venues that serve alcohol, engaging in or negotiating play while intoxicated is strongly discouraged.\nPittsburgh Bridge wishes to create the safest possible environment for the attendees of our events. As such, we take sexual assault and other major consent violations very seriously. Anyone credibly accused of such a violation may be asked not to attend events organized by Pittsburgh Bridge. When these issues arise, Bridge generally adheres to the NCSF Guide for Groups.\nIt is much better for everyone, however, if these incidents never happen in the first place, so we also support prevention activities including education in consent and safety. Even in the presence of these measures, attendees should understand that no environment is completely safe and that they are ultimately responsible for their own well being.\n","date":1597276800,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","objectID":"b385a29b192bb278f9ba9613b7b5a8b8","permalink":"https://pghbridge.github.io/web/group-info/guidelines/","publishdate":"2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","title":"Guidelines for Conduct"},{"content":"National Coalition for Sexual Freedom\nNCSF offers legal services for a variety of problems associated with alternative lifestyles. https://www.ncsfreedom.org\nKink Aware Professionals Guide https://ncsfreedom.org/resources/kink-aware-professionals-directory/kap-directory-homepage.html\nMunch and Adult Local Link Directory http://findamunch.com\nExperienced Kinksters on BDSM Getting into the BDSM Community\nhttps://fetlife.com/groups/3115/group_posts/980383\nView PDF: Getting into the BDSM Community Safety in the Scene\nhttps://fetlife.com/groups/3115/group_posts/3252012\nView PDF: Safety in the Scene FAQ\nhttps://fetlife.com/groups/3115/group_posts/534028\nView PDF: FAQ How to Find a Partner\nhttps://fetlife.com/users/118352/posts/1373232\nView PDF: How to Find a Partner\n","date":1597276800,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","objectID":"abb7428078bd28075f6bd7e89f6156eb","permalink":"https://pghbridge.github.io/web/group-info/resources/","publishdate":"2020-08-13T00:00:00Z","title":"Resources"},{"content":"TNG is a group under the Bridge umbrella focused on the needs of the 18-35 age demographic (and their partners) of our community.
